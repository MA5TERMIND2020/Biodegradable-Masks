<h1>The Future of Personal M95 Grade Air Filtration Masks is Here!</h1>
<p>For the past 5 years in a row we've been setting the record for the hottest recorded temperature to date.<brk>
 We cannot continue to survive with such high smog levels and polution, the time is now to make things more eco-friendly.</p><brk>

 <body>Up until today the only company to successfully commercialize a bio-polycarbonate product has been the Japanese corporation Mitsubishi Chemical.

This latest discovery was made by Dr Jeyoung Park, Dr Dongyeop Oh, and Dr Sung Yeon Hwang of the Research Center for Bio-based Chemistry at KRICT, who were able to develop an alternative commercially viable bio-polycarbonate using the plant-based components of isosorbide and nanocellulose.

In addition to its strength, the new polycarbonate is also highly transparent, with a light transmittance measurement of 93%. As the scientific journal EurekaAlert explains, â€œThis is due to the suppressed crystallinity through the dispersed nanocellulose and the result is very superior to commercially available petroleum polycarbonate.

Bio-Polycarbonate Low Toxicity
Furthermore, the bio-polycarbonate has also shown to be much safer than petrochemical polymers, making it possible to use in products where BPA is not.</body>
